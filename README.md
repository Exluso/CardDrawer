# CardDrawer
Draw cards from a 52 card deck and display them on screen (learning project).

## Basic Idea
Simulate a deck of card from which the user can draw cards and display them on the "board".

1. draw a card from the deck
2. lay cards on the board
3. discard the card to a discard pile
4. shuffle the deck
5. reset (add the discard pile to the deck and then shuffle)
6. save the current status of
	- discard pile
	- board
	- deck
